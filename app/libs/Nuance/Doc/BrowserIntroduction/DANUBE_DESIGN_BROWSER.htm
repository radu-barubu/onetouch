        <h1>Nuance SpeechAnywhere design</h1>
        <p>Nuance SpeechAnywhere has been designed based on our extensive experience in both the medical and speech recognition fields. It is important to be aware of the design when integrating Nuance SpeechAnywhere into your application in order to get the most out of it. Please spend some time with our documentation before implementing it.</p>
        <h2>Nuance SpeechAnywhere...</h2>
        <ul style="list-style-type: square;">
            <li>Is platform-independent; our functionality can be used from a wide variety of client platforms: Windows desktop, smart phones, web browsers. Our name is our objective: speech anywhere!</li>
            <li>Enables you provide core speech recognition functionality with minimum effort and time.</li>
        </ul>
        <ul style="list-style-type: square;">
            <li>Supports medical report creation via frontend speech recognition.</li>
            <li>Supports immediate correction/finalization by the end user. By design, end users cannot play back dictated sound. Also, end end users cannot defer correction – Nuance provides a wide range of other products for medical report creation that support workflows for dictation with deferred correction.</li>
            <li>Uses speech recognition to speed up report creation: voice commands, navigation, etc.</li>
            <li>Needs reasonable recording times of several words/groups of sentences for good recognition results. This means that speaking single words or very short utterances can lead to poor recognition results.</li>
            <li>Does not need complex integration changes when you upgrade to a new version. All new features are available to your end users without you having to program them in your application.</li>
            <li>Is not a medical transcription platform – there are other SDKs in the Nuance Healthcare Development Platform that are optimized for medical transcription.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Features under consideration for future releases</h2>
        <ul style="list-style-type: square;">
            <li>Auto-texts (macros/normals).</li>
            <li>Extended platform support: for example, Citrix, WTS.</li>
            <li>Additional correction and navigation features.</li>
        </ul>
